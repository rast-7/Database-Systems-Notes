# Database-Systems-Notes

This repo will have all my notes about database systems from the papers I read and my own experiences.
I hope these will be of help to others too :)

# Want to discuss something related to database systems?
Create an issue and we can discuss there :)

Also, since you are here, I have a song suggestion for you:
