# Database-Systems-Notes

This repo will have all my notes about database systems from the papers I read and my own experiences.
I hope these will be helpful for others too :)

I inted to create a very basic database of my own from scratch. This is the very first step in that direction.


# Want to discuss something related to database systems?
Create an issue and we can discuss there :)

Also, since you are here, I have a song suggestion for you:
